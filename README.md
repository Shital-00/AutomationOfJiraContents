Automatically Download Specific images and rename with them

For Privacy Concern Some Constrain of Jira such as api token ,Jira domain,Board-Id,Username,Sprint-Id,Keyword - thumb,door removed from code because it lead to cause error for pushing into github .Instead of this you can use your jira constrain.
First run the IconAndScreenshotDownloader scene is run then all the images are downloaded into your local folder in pc.
second run RenameImageinScene is run while runing we have to give that folder which has downloaded images and give destination folder which we have to push all renamed images after renaming and click rename button .
after this the destination folder has all renamed images will be there .
